# Node.js Random Color Generator

.) The CLI creates a random HEX color which is displayed to the console as a box of hashes (#). The HEX code is shown centered inside the box.

.) Furthermore, the CLI accepts a first input of a color (a hue) and a second input of the value "light" or "dark". If those values are provided, the resulting random color will have a corresponding hue or lightness factor.

.) The first input can also be a value in the format WWxHH. If provided by the user in that way, the box will appear with the requested width and height.

.) Users can also enter "ask" as the first argument. This triggers two questions (enter color and brightness). If the color (hue) value is not found, the program will ask again.
